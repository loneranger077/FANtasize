FANtasize is a concert/event search app which allows the user to query Seatgeek's API database with a musical artist/event name plus their location and returns the nearest and soonest relevant events. It displays the name, venue, date/time, lowest and average ticket prices plus a link to purchase tickets in addition to the current weather data in that city in addition to a photo relevant to that performance. Searches can be made by pressing enter or the search button, and there is input validation but a user does not have to input both parameters: you can search for all events in one city without putting an artist, or all events with a given artist regardless of location.
